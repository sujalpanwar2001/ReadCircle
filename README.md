## Overview
ReadCircle enables users to register, validate accounts via email, manage their book collections, and borrow/return books with real-time notifications. Built with enterprise-grade security (Keycloak + JWT) and deployed to production on Oracle Cloud, this platform showcases scalable full-stack development with modern DevOps practices.

## Features
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure signup with email validation and role-based access control
- **Book Management**: Create, update, share, and archive personal book collections
- **Smart Borrowing**: Automated availability checks and borrow request workflows
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Instant WebSocket updates for borrow/return events
- **Return Management**: Streamlined return process with approval workflows
- **Performance Optimized**: Lazy loading, pagination, and caching for responsive experience
